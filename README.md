Agenda: 
1. search or click on list of Bart station and check bart status

To Start:
$ npm start

Potential Improvements:
1. Use Redux, currently not very scalable 
2. Make prettier...(and responsive)
3. More modularized. 

FeedBack:
1. Good exercise, doable in 2-4 hours given allowing to use CRA.
    (create-react-app is great.. never used it before)
2. Good exercise on parsing JSON too.
